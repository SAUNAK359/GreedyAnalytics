Analytics@LLM — How to Use

1) Upload datasets & documents
- Open the Ingestion section.
- Upload CSV, XLS/XLSX, Parquet, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, SAP/Tally exports.
- Mixed formats are supported; schema will be inferred automatically.

2) Ask questions via Copilot
- Click the floating 🤖 Copilot icon to open the chat panel.
- Ask questions in natural language.
- Copilot plans → executes → verifies, then mutates the dashboard via MCP.

3) Mutate dashboards
- Copilot never returns charts directly.
- It generates MCP updates that render live in the dashboard canvas.

4) Version & rollback
- Each MCP change creates a new version.
- Use the Versioning panel to roll back or compare versions.

5) Deploy dashboards
- MCP versions are deployable artifacts.
- Export MCP JSON for governance review and production rollout.

6) Governance behavior
- PII detection is automatic.
- Column sensitivity is tagged.
- Role-based redaction is enforced.

Notes
- API keys can be set in Streamlit secrets or entered in the top bar.
- No static dashboards; everything is live and explainable.
